This repository contains the code for our [ICPR 2018 (Beijing, China)](http://www.icpr2018.org/) Paper:

[Class2Str: End to End Latent Hierarchy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06675)

## Usage

For running on CIFAR 10, first create a directory name `cifar_10` and dump the CIFAR 10 data in batches of 10000 in the following format:

```
--- cifar_10
  --- data_batch_1
  --- data_batch_2
  --- ...
  --- test_batch

```
